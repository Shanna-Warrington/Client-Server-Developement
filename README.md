# Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To be able to write programs that are maintanable, readable and adaptable you need to make the code easy to read, keeps to a consistant style, and is easy to test. By doing this it makes it easier for the next person that uses that code or even yourself months later to pick it up quick. Keeping the functions small and meaningfully named will also help to make this code reuseable. By naming the functions with names that indicate what they are used for, you make it easier to find and call the function that is needed. The CRUD module could be used in the future to search any database that has been imported. That makes it good or useful code.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I don't feel that I have much experience as a computer science, due to still being a student, but I try to break down what the client wants into small sections. That lets me know what the client wants and each task can be made into a function. By breaking the clients demands into smaller pieces it allows me to work through each one without getting overwhelmed. I believe this strategy will work well with future clients. It may just need some fine tuning and how I go from figuring out the tasks to making them into a function that is modular and testable.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I believe that computer scientists help to solve problems and find new ways to do things, just like any other scientist. Instead of figuring out what, how, and why of a creature like a biology scientist, computer scientists figure it out for computer programs. They do this by taking a problem or need of a client and figuring out the best way to solve their issue and make the need happen. This in turn allows the client to run their business better.
